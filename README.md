**Animal trading card project**

_**Overview:**_
This is my first project for the Google-Udacity Scholarship, FRONT-END track and also part of the Google-Udacity Nanodegree program (Web foundations module).I had to use what I've learned about HTML and CSS to convert a design prototype into a functional webpage.

_**Project Development:**_
According to the Project Specification criteria, I used HTML and CSS. Once built the project, I had to check it against the Project Rubric provided by Udacity, to make sure I've satisfied all requirements. My submission should resemble the design prototype, but it's okay if it doesn't match exactly, so long as I satisfy all the requirements.
